 * The FM worklet's tunables (#644): table size, mip count, the control-rate

 * shortest envelope segment. Data, not logic: every other module under `fm/`
 * imports what it needs from here, and none of these is read by the main
 * thread. A change here changes every render; `fmProcessorGolden.test.ts`
 * says so, and `fmProcessorKernel.test.ts` pins `MOD_INDEX_SCALE` against the
 * bank it was authored at (#543).
